Idea:
 App where users can receive information about cycling routes  (urban and rural ), relevant shops and interact with fellow cyclists.
 
Problem Solved:
Although general information about cycling routes in Nepal is readily available, it is difficult to find exact routes. 
The second problem it solves is that it is hard to find possible short and effective routes when traveling through urban areas. 
Finally, the problem of finding out the best places to acquire the necessary equipment is also solved by the application.
So, as a whole, the app tries to promote cycling in Nepal as well as interaction between cyclists and at the same time project Nepal as a cycle-friendly nation.
 
Functions:
 1) Shows start and end points, the average time required, pictures, and all other relevant details on cycle trails for tourists and also allows discussions on the topics.
2) Shows short paths for cyclists in urban area so as to avoid having to take the main roads among the larger vehicles, leading to a less stressful and dangerous ride. 
3) Displays locations of shops and stores that sell cycling gears and other necessary equipment. 
 
Targeted audience:
 Three major target audience for our application would be:
1) Tourists looking for great cycling trails. 
2) People who generally pick cycles as their preferred mode of transportation.
3) Cycling enthusiasts. 
 
Main Benefits:
1. Get informed about awesome cycle trails in and around the valley as well as exotic mountain trails all around the nation.
2. Learn about short and effective cycle routes for easier, shorter and safer ride. 
3. Find out about shops, stores and other relevant places a cyclist needs to know about.
4. Interact with other cyclists about the trails, stores, etc.
