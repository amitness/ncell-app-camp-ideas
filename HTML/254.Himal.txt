Problem Solved:
Nepal is a country full of beautiful mountains. We have the highest peak in the world and many peaks that come under top 10 in the world.

It also would include a search option from where people can search about a specific mountain. Various features such as picture of the day which would show a beautiful picture of a mountain or mountain of the day which shows a short description and info about it. It would also provide travel agencies from where they can  book the trip to climb those mountains.

 The main target audience are tourists who come to visit Nepal. Those people who are in love with nature. Also everyday people who may want to know more about mountains.
