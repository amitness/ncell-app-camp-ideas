Jello misuses the magic stick and traps Jellians. The gameplay includes the character Bubbly travelling in a sled freeing trapped Jellians and earning points. The Heaven doesnt have gravity so sled can climb in steep lands too. The gameplay is exciting due to use of lots of particles effects for speed ups, freeing the trapped Jellians, etc. This game is being developed in Unity Game Engine.
