Problem Solved:
We human being easily trust each other however these trust issue changes when one is out of home especially crosses border of nepal. The problem what we are trying to deal is Human trafficking  ( sex trafficking, child labour, forced labour, modern slavery ).

Few of the statistics : 
National Human rights commission Nepal 2014 reports statistics shows nearly 29,000 persons were trafficked or attempted to trafficked. [2]
Global slavery Index 2014 reports that 35.8 million people are enslaved globally where few of the countries figures are [1]
Nepal 228,700    
India 14,285,700 
Pakistan 2,058,200 
Bangladesh 680,900
 
According to the Nepal Population Census 2011, there were 1.92 million absentees population in 2011 in Nepal. 228,700 nepalese are enslaved and 1.92 are absent whereas the prevention , rescue figure is nominal [2].
