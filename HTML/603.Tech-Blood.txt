Functions:
 1. User sign up to the system along with their Mobile Number. The Mobile number is confirmed using Call/SMS.
2. User can search and request for Blood when required. The server after receiving this request,responds to the possible donor according to their current location about the requirement.
3. All mobile numbers are verified because the motive of this app is to be operated in emergencies.
4. All mobile numbers are hidden so as to avoid unnecessary calls one may receive (when their number is made publicly visible).
5. Donor's who've donated blood in less than 90 days will not be shown. This is because a person can donate blood only once every 12-16 weeks.
