Functions:
 Flipped is a platform-adventure video game with a 2d-sidescroller world. The player has to guide a boy through a world where the obstacles are ‘Mirrors’ such that when the protagonist encounters a mirror, he is ported to a world where everything gets flipped i.e, turns upside down. In this alternate world, the gravity works in the opposite direction. The protagonist now walks on ceilings, jumping takes him to a lower height rather than higher; just opposite to that in a real world scenario. Presence of hyperreal objects, that are not affected by change of reality and have constant direction of fall, make things more interesting. This way, a world with obstacles is presented and the player needs to make proper decisions in order to tackle the obstructions and march forward.
 
The storyline starts with a scene of a boy and his pet dog playing around. Day turns into night, and it’s time for them to sleep. As they are dozing off in the boy’s bed, something odd happens: there’s lightning and shaking and a portal, or “Mirror” as we call it, appears in the room. The shaking causes the dog to fall through the mirror and disappear. Now the whole game is a mission undertaken by the boy in the search of his lost dog.
