Problem Solved:
Travel can only be meaningful if we do travel with comfort and hassle free way. With our sajilo yatra app travel service provider won’t have to wait for passenger in random place if they do have vacant seats.  Similarly passenger will get to know about the deals(vacant seats) and route detail by contacting the service provider instantly.
 
We have to roam around, deal with the middleman when we reach new place. Which is time consuming and tedious job. With our app, user can get to know about the deals and discounts with booking facilities of destination place which will make the accommodation easy.
