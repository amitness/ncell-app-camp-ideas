Idea:
 Place to find your next work space. Need a place to work for a day/week/month or year? We find it for you.
 
Problem Solved:
Having been a one man team for quite long time, I had issues finding a place to go to and work. I needed an office space but sometimes for a day and sometimes for a week or so. Coffee shops were my only alternate back then because I did not have enough info. This app will help bridge the gap between offices or work space owners who have a desk free or a room or probably a meeting room they can rent for a few hours with the people specially startup guys, since they can't afford a full-stack office right from the start.
BootSpace: Get your work space sorted.
 
Functions:
 Lists out places available to crash in and start working for a day/week/month or even years.
Helps people with extra desk or room to list for rent.
 
Targeted audience:
 The target audience for this will be basically entrepreneurs, team or person looking to work in office environment, without commitment for the place. Head bangers and Idea creators and curators. 
 
Main Benefits:
There are two user levels.
1. Person looking for a work desk or room or even flats
2. Person looking to rent out spare room or desk or flat for work.
 
The major issue this solves is to find a temporary work space for people who are travelling but need a place for a day or two to get some work done, or startup owners who can not afford to rent the whole thing as they need to do a minimum months contract.
Also this opens up business oppurtunity for people with extra space. All they can do is get a few furnitures and internet. They can then go ahead and rent it out.
 
Platform: Android
