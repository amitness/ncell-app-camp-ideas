Official (governmental) works can get quite confusing and troublesome when we do not know the details such as documents required, fees, letters, and others. Some examples of such works could be â€“ at DOTM for license issue/renew; citizenship issue; applications for Loksewa exams; and so on. Even if some of the details are known beforehand, it is easy to miss a few things and returning back home to get the thing could be troublesome especially on a busy day.
