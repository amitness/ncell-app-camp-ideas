Idea:
 A tourism app that enclose all information about place, activity, routes (i.e. cycling,trekking), food, culture and history around user location
 
Problem Solved:
Last year I and my colleague had visited Annapurna Trekking Circuit. We got a chance to interact with international tourist in our short journey. Lot of them are carrying paper list of the place and thing to do around in that place. Some of them are even asking local people about the trekking route and time schedule. I get a chance to interact with a girl from Arizona who mention me about lack of proper information in internet about the places and routes and exact time for these local routes for tourist who don’t want to spend money on tourist guide. At the end of talk she told me “No plan is good plan.”
Problems Plan:
·         An apps that handle database about the location, historical background, routes (i.e. cycling routes, trekking routes) approximate timing etc.
·         A guiding apps that make list of stuff you must do around your location.
