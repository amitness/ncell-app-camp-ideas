Functions:
 The new version here is majority group move of  piece/s will be valid as per time set by - in one single piece and if one IP player fail to move his idea piece/s in (set) time move be invalid. Even as the minority will be there even in same envn chessboard.
Therefore it's all about game brain data creation.
