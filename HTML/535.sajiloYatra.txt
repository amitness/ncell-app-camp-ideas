This app will also provide focussed information about tourism fostering areas. This will save time and effort to both the parties: service provider(ministry of transportation and transportation owner) and service user(public.tourists). All available routes throughout the country will be displayed in this app with different means of transportation like airways,roadways and when user click on his/her destinied place(TO and FROM) every available routes will be shown with time schedules, price of tickets which would solve management problem of government,ticket counter and owner.And of course to the public for getting relaible information about transportation facilities.
