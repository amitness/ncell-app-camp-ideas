Idea:
 Capture experience of travellers in multimedia form allowing viewer to decide their travelling destination according to others experience & rating
 
Problem Solved:
This app is focused on allowing users to post only their travelling experience. It requires users to create account and post their experience just like in facebook allowing others to view their posts (videos,photos,texts,voices) but in more organized way then ever before.
They will be able to rate places according to their experience which will help other travellers to decide their next destination.
Users will have ability to make their post public or private according to their wish.
People will have much better idea before travelling if they are willing to travel new destination for the first time.
Users can later view their own posts for renewing their old memories.
We believe this will dramatically change the way people travel. this will revolutionarize travelling as a social activity. Hence, dramatially improving tourism.
