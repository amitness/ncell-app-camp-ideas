Idea:
 A hardware merged app that indicates water level status on any reservoir , provides ON/OFF control remotely from the app and helps maintain usage log.
 
Problem Solved:
1) Provides instant information on water level in the reservoir
2) Prevents water overflow
3) Fills the reservoir when empty based on automatic/ preset 
4) Provdies water usage log based on client requirements
5) Facilates communication between client and water supplier/s
 
Functions:
 1) The App provides instant information on water level in the reservoir
2) App controls the system ( eg. a motor) remotely ( both manually or automatically based on preset value)
3)  App provides water usage log 
4) App communicates between water supplier and client
5) minimal and user friendly interface 
 
Targeted audience:
 1) Home based users looking for automation in thier water reservoir 
2) Water plants looking for automation in thier water reservoir 
3) Water suppliers 
 
Main Benefits:
1) One touch ON/OFF of the system via the app
2) Automated / remote control of water level in the reservoir 
3) Accurate water level measurement ( industrial application )
4) On the go communication between client and water supplier
5) Easy to maintain water usage log 
 
Platform: Android
