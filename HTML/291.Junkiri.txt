Idea:
 Considering the shy nature or feeling offended to share about the sexual related problems(specially females) this app will help them.
 
Problem Solved:
This application actually is being developed with a view to overcome the sexual related problem or disease that gets even bad since the people finds it very difficult to share and talk about it with someone else due to their shy nature. Like the difficulties during menstruation,any kinds of infections around genitals due to lack of hygiene are limited with in the woman and in about 80% cases they are unshared and remains uncured.
So this app will try to suggest them the best they can do at those situations and helps solving such problems.If the case seems to be very serious or something then will recommend the nearest healthpost from his/her location .

 The main Functions and elements of our app are explained below as:

2.The app will contain the lists of problems and solutions in a very well categorized manner. The main category will be "MALE" and "FEMALE" and then the problems related to them will be encountered.
3.With the increasing number of problems the app will be updated accordingly from our web server.
4.If the user dont find their problems in our listing then they can post it in a the Forum available being completely anonymous.After that as fast as possibleÂ  if our team finds it a appropriate problem it will be very soon updated with in the application.
 
Targeted audience:
