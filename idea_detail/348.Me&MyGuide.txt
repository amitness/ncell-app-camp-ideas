Idea:
 An app that creates the direct connection between a tourist and a guide.
 
Problem Solved:
Most of the times when a tourist tries to visit Nepal, he might not know about the local areas.And many of the cash is taken by the mediators/agents. So this app tries to connect all the registered guides with their contact information directly to tourist. New persons can also guide tourists and earn some for him/her by registering with us.
 
Functions:
 1. Connect a tourist directly to a guide as soon as tourist lands in Nepal.
2. Give some earning to talented and free people.
3. Keeps flashing ad about various local products and other shops while the app is being used.
4. Available in some other variable language to tourists.
 
Targeted audience:
 1. The main target audience will be tourists  who are visiting nepal.
2. Registered guides who can be connected directly by the tourists.
3. Local person  can also earn some if they know about their locality and know a foreign language.
4. Different type of shops can place their ad of their special products. So that tourist can see it and if interested can get that product.ie InApp Advertisements
 
Main Benefits:
1. It connects tourists directly to the guide. So tourist directly pay to the guide. No person to take commison as the mediator.
2. It gives chance to those persons who are free, know about their locality,and know a foreign language; to earn some money. So you aint wasting your free time. Time is valuable. Its good to earn some.
3. A newly arrived tourist can directly search guide through this app. Guide will be available to him as soon as he lands in the airport.
