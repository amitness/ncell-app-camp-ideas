Similarly, for the other staffs such as nurse, lab technician, etc, they can also have a separate discussion forum where they can discuss their own problems openly so that they can implement in their working place to make the place more better for the patients (such as "What is the best way to inject the patient without making him/her in pain?"). Finally, the vacancy section in the app is a minor feature but this will solve all the other problems regarding the job requirement to the health staffs all over Nepal.
