Problem Solved:
1. Most of the tourists from countries like China come to Nepal in search of specific statues. They keep on wondering shop by shop for the status of their choice. In this app tourists can search the statue by name and get the list of related statues where they can find the brief detail about the location and price.
2. Tourists who are new to Nepal may not have clear view on different hand made products by Nepalese. This app will emphasize popular hand made products of Nepal and provide details about those products.
3. Tourists may be unaware about the price of Nepalese products. This app will provide price tags of product in different market along with details.
