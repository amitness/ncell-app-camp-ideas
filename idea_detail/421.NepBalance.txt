Idea:
 App that keeps track of your Mobile Balance and other information of your network.
 
 
Problem Solved:
It is hard to know how much you spend on your mobile network. Our app makes it easy by keeping track of your mobile balance over a SMS or USSD request(offered free by Network Operator) and gives the daily,weekly or yearly statical amount.
It is also not easy to locate the mobile number.Our app  gives the name of the place/zone in Nepal where the number is registered that makes it easy to locate numbers.
 
Functions:
 The app intersepts the sms request or USSD request (eg. BL to 1421(NTC), blank to 40011, *101# or *400#) and parses the remaining balance. It records and keeps track of the mobile balance. The app can be used as a phonebook that will tell you how much you spend on phone call and the location of the numbers.
Apart from that, various request to activate services and USSD codes are available.
