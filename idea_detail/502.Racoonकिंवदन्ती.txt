Idea:
 A treasure-trove of myths and history of culturally, religiously and socially venerated places, festivals and heritages for tourist guides and tourist
 
Problem Solved:
1)flourishing of misleading descriptions about touristic locations.
2)In a country like Nepal, which is bestowed with rich  cultural and social heritages, the sharp decrease in the trend of story-telling presents a grim picture.So, we want to have all the stories(myth and history) to flow not only to this generation but to the many generation to come, directly from the senior-citizens who are our last source for those invaluable stories.
3)It would be completely different experience for tourists when they get to know how and why, the cultural , social, religious and historical assets, have come to the state  as they are in front of their eye.
 
Functions:
 Functions: 
Track the location and display the heritages along with their stories

Main Benefits:
1)Comprehensive access to all the stories, they will always want to tell tourists they are guiding.
