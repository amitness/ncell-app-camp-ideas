 Atmost 4 palyers will be able to play this game. Each of them start outside a circle. Simple touch to their repective areas will toggle their position from outside to inside or vice versa. The screen will show a IN or OUT with totally random sequence. When an IN is called, the players need to stay inside the cirlce. And when an OUT is called, the players need to stay outside.
