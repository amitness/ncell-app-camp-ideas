Idea:
 Doctor Who: Need a Physician? This app tells you OPD hours of Physicians from different hospitals in your city w/ contact info for making appointments
 
Problem Solved:
Finding a proper specialist is a tedious job. From making phone calls to various hospitals to inquiring about the availibility of the doctor, this is a problem faced by every Nepali.
This app centralizes availability information from all the hospital near the user's city and presents it in a way that would be understandable even to someone who doesn't know how to use smartphone apps.
Apart from this, the app can also be used to search for services provided by Hospitals and Clinics. Such as serology tests or an MRI.
 
 
Functions:
 1) Display OPD hours of available specialists in all the hospitals/clinics in the user's city.
2) Display services offered by hospitals/clinics as per the user's request
3) View rating and reviews of individual
4) Easy and Sleek UI 
 
Targeted audience:
 Our target Audience is everyone who needs Medical Care.
 
Main Benefits:
1) The app will have a sleek and simple UI so that it can be used by even a layman.
2) Online reservation options aren't implemented in a major portion of hospitals in Nepal, so that app sticks with basic contact information of the hospital.
3) Apart from OPD hours, the app offers centralized information about services offered by hospitals such as tests (HIV Test, Pregnancy Test or an MRI)
4) Users familiar with smartphone technology can register an account to rate and review services from their recent experiences. Un-registered users can still read these reviews and ratings.
