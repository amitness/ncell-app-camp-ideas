-It also cuts carbon footprint/pollution as it makes optimal usage of the existing travel mechanisms to make deliveries possible instead of adding new ones.
 
Functions:

-Buyers/Clients can request delivery of products from potential Deliverpals traveling to their area.
-Travelers can check the app portal to track the amount of money they have made through commission on each delivery.
-Buyers/Clients can top up their Deliverpal account and make necessary transactions online to purchase products or request delivery of their products.
-Buyers can rate the services of their Deliverpals.
-The app will set limits on the type/dimensions of products that can be delivered.
