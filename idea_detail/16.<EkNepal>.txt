-App could contain various federal models that have been proposed in the past by the leaders.
 
 
 
 
Targeted audience:
 -Anyone above the age of 10. (Contains varying levels)

-Users will get to test their knowledge about the correct map of Nepal.
-User will gain knowledge about the position of cities, districts, headquarters and other important places in Nepal's map.
