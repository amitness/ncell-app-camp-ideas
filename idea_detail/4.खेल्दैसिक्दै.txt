Problem Solved:
since most of the child game mesmerize in unrealistic things like gta, counterstrike and it is unproductive in future. parent cannot do anything because they dont have time/access the internent enough. the game are not available according to child ability. now parent can be part in selection and design game for their child. similarly they can play with their child. also teacher can make mcq q&a game according to their lesson taught.
 
Functions:
 user configurable element of game like picture, sound, text.
the button can have visible/nonvisible option.
button have work like next,play,sound on/off, random also. hence nontechnical people also add/delete the content and behaviour of game.

Targeted audience:
 parents/guidance of pg to class 1.
parents who can invest time in mobile technology for their child so that they can guidance in internet too in future.
